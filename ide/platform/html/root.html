      <h1>The Symphony IDE</h1>
      <h2>Comprehensive Modelling for Advanced Systems of Systems</h2>
      <p>
        The Symphony IDE aims to support the building of models of
        System of Systems (SoSs) using the COMPASS Modelling Language
        (CML) notation and provide analysis of global properties on
        these models.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The user manuals for the different features are included as PDF files in the distribution.</li>
        <li> Public CML examples can be imported using the File -> Import -> COMPASS -> COMPASS examples selection.
			<ul>
				<li>Additional examples can be found at the <a href="http://symphonytool.org/examples" >COMPASS examples web page</a></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
        <h2>Upgrading Workspaces</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to current development pace, new versions of Symphony may
        not be compatible with workspaces from previous versions. This
        often materializes in "Editor could not be initialized"
        errors. Creating new workspaces usually solves these
        problems. In order to do so:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Delete the existing workspace folder from file system (be
          sure to backup any projects you wish to preserve).</li>
        <li>Start the Symphony IDE and point the workspace to a new
          location or recreate the old one.</li>
        <li>Recreate any projects you wish to work on. Afterwards use
          Import... -> File System to import the relevant CML sources
          into your new projects.
      </ol> 
      <p>
        <h2>Submitting bugs</h2>
      </p>
