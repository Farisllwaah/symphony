RTTPLUGIN_0.3.7

Development version
Changes:

[2d5aea5]:
- import now automatically generates test cases from the model.
- added functionality to automatically test all test cases of a requirement.
- added functionality to automatically test a single test case.
- added support for iterative test generation (if not all of the defined
  test goals can be covered during test generation, a new test procedure
  generation context is created with the remaining goals and the test
  generation is triggered again. This iteration stops if no goals could
  be covered or all goals have been covered)
- Added support for new flag IterTPGEN in the properties dialog of a test
  procedure generation context (and in the respective configuration file
  advanced.conf).
  Note: If the flag is not present in the current advanced.conf of a test
  procedure generation context, this flag is set to -1 in the dialog and
  the plugin will not add its value to the file advanced.conf unless
  explicitly changed to 0 or 1 by the user. This will be changed with the
  next RTT-MBT release version (9.0-1.4.0) that will support this flag.
